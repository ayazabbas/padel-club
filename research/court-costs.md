# Court Costs

*Last Updated: 3 February 2026*

## Summary

| Option | Cost per Court | Best For |
|--------|----------------|----------|
| Indoor (warehouse) | £25-35k | Cheapest — no groundworks |
| Outdoor on tarmac + canopy | £35-50k | Existing hard surface (e.g. Laporte) |
| Outdoor + groundworks | £53-75k | Greenfield sites |
| Budget (China) | £10-20k | Lower quality, small clubs |

**Key insight:** Groundworks are 50% of outdoor costs — avoid if possible.

## Option 1: Indoor Warehouse Conversion (Recommended)

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Court structure (EU) | £25-40k |
| Groundworks | £0 |
| **Total per court** | **£25-35k** |

Best value — floor already flat, no groundworks needed.

---

## Option 2: Outdoor on Existing Tarmac + Canopy

For sites like Laporte Retail Park with existing hard surface:

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Court structure | £25-35k |
| Canopy/cover | £10-15k |
| Minor surface prep | £0-5k |
| **Total per court** | **£35-50k** |

Skips expensive groundworks. Surface must be level and well-drained.

## Option 3: Outdoor + Groundworks (Greenfield)

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Groundworks (ringbeam) | £28-35k |
| Court structure | £25-40k |
| **Total per court** | **£53-75k** |

Required for undeveloped land (e.g. Slip End).

---

## Option 4: Budget (China/Alibaba)

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Court delivered to UK | £10-20k |
| Installation | £5-10k |
| **Total per court** | **£15-30k** |

Quality concerns but viable for small clubs starting out.
