{: .no_toc }

*Last updated: 3 February 2026*

## Summary

**Your Situation:** 4 partners with £80k pooled capital opening a padel club in Luton. The owner is Muslim and cannot use interest-based (riba) financing.

- ✅ **Government grants are available** and are inherently halal (no interest, no repayment)

- 🟡 **Halal crowdfunding is emerging** but largely property-focused (Nester, Qardus)

### Recommended Funding Stack

## Islamic Finance Structures Explained

Understanding the key structures helps you evaluate options and have informed conversations with providers.

<details>
<summary><strong>Murabaha (Cost-Plus Financing)</strong></summary>

The most common structure for SME finance in the UK.

**How it works:**
1. The lender purchases the asset/commodity you need
2. They sell it to you at a pre-agreed markup (their profit)
3. You repay in fixed instalments

**Example:** You need £50,000 for court installation. The lender buys the equipment, sells it to you for £55,000 (£5,000 markup), payable over 24 months.

**Key points:**
- The markup is fixed upfront — no variable interest
- If you default, no additional late fees (in strict Sharia compliance)
- Used by: Qardus, SME Loans, QIB UK

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Musharakah (Partnership/Joint Venture)</strong></summary>

A profit-and-loss sharing arrangement — ideal for bringing in investors.

**How it works:**
1. Two or more parties contribute capital to a venture
2. Profits are shared according to a pre-agreed ratio
3. Losses are shared in proportion to capital contribution

**Example:** An investor contributes £50k to your padel club. You agree they receive 20% of profits until the investment is repaid, then 5% ongoing.

**Diminishing Musharakah:**
- Common for property — one party gradually buys out the other's share
- Used by Gatehouse Bank for home finance

**Best for:** Bringing in Muslim investors who want Sharia-compliant returns

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Ijara (Lease)</strong></summary>

A Sharia-compliant leasing arrangement.

**How it works:**
1. The lessor (finance company) owns the asset
2. You pay rent to use it
3. At the end, the asset may transfer to you (Ijara wa Iqtina)

**Example:** A finance company buys padel court equipment and leases it to you for 5 years. At the end, ownership transfers.

**Key points:**
- The lessor bears ownership risk
- Maintenance responsibilities depend on the contract
- Similar to conventional operating lease

**Best for:** Equipment financing where you don't want upfront capital outlay

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Qard Hasan (Interest-Free Loan)</strong></summary>

A benevolent loan with no profit for the lender.

**How it works:**
- The lender provides money as a loan
- The borrower repays only the principal — no markup
- Often used for charitable purposes

**Where to find:**
- Family and community (most common)
- Some Islamic charities
- Government grants function similarly (no repayment at all)

**Note:** Commercial providers rarely offer this as there's no business model.

## LTA Padel Funding (⚠️ NOT Sharia-Compliant)

- **Structure:** Loan with interest repayment

**What it funds:**
- Covered/floodlit courts
- Padel construction projects

**Requirements:**
- Not-for-profit, accessible organisation
- 15+ hours public access per week
- LTA registered venue

**Verdict:** ❌ Not suitable for Muslim owners due to interest

**Alternative:** Apply for the grant elements (if any) or seek equivalent Sharia-compliant finance for the same project.

## Case Study: The Padel Club Funding

A UK padel company's recent raise shows what's possible:

**The Padel Club:**
- Raised £3.8m in latest funding round
- £1.5m from NPIF II (Northern Powerhouse Investment Fund)
- Managed by Praetura Equity Finance

**Key insight:** Equity investment is an option for growth-stage padel businesses.

**Note:** This was conventional equity investment, not Islamic finance, but demonstrates investor appetite for UK padel.
