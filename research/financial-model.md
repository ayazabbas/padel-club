## Recommendations

1. **Start with 4 courts if possible** — Economies of scale make this significantly more profitable than 2
2. **Secure funding before signing lease** — Don't commit until capital is confirmed
3. **Target rent <£45k/year** — This keeps margins healthy across all scenarios
4. **Build community from day 1** — Occupancy is everything; invest in staff and marketing
5. **Phase expansion** — Can add café, coaching, gym later when cash-positive
