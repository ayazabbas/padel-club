# Legal & Regulatory Requirements

*Last Updated: 3 February 2026*

## Summary

- **Planning:** Indoor sports = Use Class E(d). Outdoor + buildings on land = full planning application.
- **Class E advantage:** Gyms, cafés, co-working, sports all in one class — can switch freely.
- **Insurance:** Public liability essential, employers liability if staff.

## Planning Permission

### Use Classes (Key for Us)

| Class | Includes | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| **E(a)** | Shops, retail | — |
| **E(b)** | Cafés, restaurants | ✅ For future café |
| **E(c)** | Offices | ✅ For co-working space |
| **E(d)** | Indoor sport, recreation, gyms | ✅ For padel + gym |
| **E(g)** | Light industrial, offices | — |

**Key benefit:** All Class E uses can switch between each other **without planning permission**. A mixed-use facility with padel, gym, café, and co-working could all operate under Class E.

### Warehouse Conversion

| From | To | Requirement |
|------|-----|-------------|
| Already Class E | Padel/gym/café | No planning needed |
| B2 (Industrial) | Class E | Planning application |
| B8 (Storage) | Class E | Planning application |

### Building on Open Land (e.g., Slip End, Laporte)

**Full planning permission required** for:
- New buildings (reception, café, gym, co-working)
- Change of use from agricultural/storage to leisure
- Outdoor sports courts with structures

**Application should include:**
- Site plan and building designs
- Access and parking arrangements
- Environmental impact (drainage, noise, lighting)
- Transport assessment

**Pre-application advice strongly recommended** — Luton Council offers this.

### Mixed-Use Development

For a facility with padel + reception + café + gym + co-working:

| Element | Use Class | Planning |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Padel courts (outdoor) | Sui generis / E(d) | Full application |
| Reception building | Ancillary | Included in main application |
| Café | E(b) | Can include in Class E application |
| Gym | E(d) | Can include in Class E application |
| Co-working | E(c) | Can include in Class E application |

**Strategy:** Apply for a mixed Class E development — this gives flexibility to adjust the mix later without new planning applications.
