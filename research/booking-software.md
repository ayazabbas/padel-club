## Recommendation

**Build custom + list on Playtomic for visibility:**

1. **Build our own booking system** — founders are developers, essentially free
2. **Also list on Playtomic** — for player discovery and community (can link to our booking)
3. **Expand system later** — add gym booking, co-working, café loyalty, membership tiers

This gives us full control, zero ongoing fees, and still benefits from Playtomic's marketing reach.
