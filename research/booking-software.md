## Recommendation

**For a new club with development capability:**
1. **Build custom** — lower long-term cost, full control, supports mixed-use (padel + gym + co-working)
2. **List on Playtomic** as additional channel for visibility (can do both)

**For quick launch without dev resources:**
1. Start with **Court22** (lower fees) or **Playtomic** (more reach)
2. Consider custom build later when profitable
