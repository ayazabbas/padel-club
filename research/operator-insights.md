## Revenue & Economics

### UK Market Data (Feb 2025 AMA - Court Builder)

> "Some courts in the UK are generating £150k per year per court. We know of a site in the midlands which has 10+ courts, 87% occupancy and generates **£1.3m per annum** from court bookings alone. The bar takes £9k a week."

> "Break even depends on the site, average around **18-24 months**. We did a feasibility study for a hotel in Wales and the break even was 11 months."

### Europe vs US Economics (Jan 2026 Reddit)

A major analysis on r/padel highlighted the funding gap between US and European padel:

**European advantages:**
- Ireland: €230M in community sports grants, with tennis clubs receiving €60-120k each for padel courts
- Germany: Federal, state, and municipal sports facility funding available
- Italy: Significant municipal investment in community sports

**US challenges:**
- Almost entirely private developer funding
- Overhead costs in major cities: **$140,000-$750,000/year** just to keep doors open (rent, insurance, labor)
- No public subsidy = must target premium pricing to make numbers work

> "When you can only fit 3 courts in your space and your rent is ~$40-50K/month, you have to target the demographic that can and will pay."

**Takeaway for UK:** While we don't have European-level grants, Sport England funding exists. The key is keeping overhead low through smart property selection.

### Portugal Club Owner (Nov 2024 AMA)

> "The key part of the business is the rent you pay. In our case it's approximately **1/7 to 1/8 of the revenue** so we have a lot of margin for everything else."

> "A big part of the business are the people. If you have good people working it will bring more players and more revenue than automation possibly can."

8 courts, open 07:00-24:00, ~8.3 hours occupancy per day average.

**Napkin math from thread:**
- 8 courts × 8.3 hrs/day × 365 days × €20/hr = **€484,800/year turnover**
- Court cost: ~€30k each indoor
- Additional infrastructure (kitchen, bar, toilets, lockers): ~€150k
- Rent: ~€70k/year (1/7 of turnover)

## Warnings & Failures

### Sweden Market Crash

> "Here we went from 500 courts to maybe less than 50 courts within 2 years. Padel is amazing at bankrupting people."

Source: [Reddit - Funding Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/padel/comments/1h4d26i/best_way_of_funding_a_padel_start_up_business/)

### Hands-Off Approach Failures

> "Unfortunately operators have gone into administration using this approach [automated/self-sufficient]. A successful club needs to have a good strategy, social experience, dwell time, coaching program etc."

Source: [Reddit AMA - UK Court Builder](https://www.reddit.com/r/padel/comments/1iwkpce/i_build_padel_courts_and_clubs_in_the_uk_ama/)

### UK Quality Concerns (SAPCA Warning)

The UK's Sports and Play Construction Association (SAPCA) raised alarms about declining build standards as demand surges:
- Wobbling glass panels
- Structural issues
- Courts with impervious concrete that fills with water
- One operator wasted £50,000 on a court they had to dig up and rebuild

**Lesson:** Don't rush to meet demand by cutting corners. Vet builders carefully.

## Critical Success Factors

Based on Reddit discussions:

1. **Location & Rent** — Rent should be <15% of projected revenue
2. **Staff Quality** — Human connection drives repeat business
3. **Community Building** — Social experience, not just courts
4. **Coaching Program** — Revenue stream + player development
5. **Dwell Time** — Bar/café keeps people longer, builds community
6. **Realistic Expectations** — Not a passive income business

## Finding Sites (UK)

> "The site is without a doubt the hardest stage of the process in our experience."

Key challenges:
- Industrial warehouse availability
- Ceiling height requirements (7m+)
- Planning permission for change of use
- Parking and access

## Booking Platforms

### Playtomic Debate

> "Playtomic is not expensive at all for clubs and they get way more benefits than cons. They don't understand their role in the Padel community as a club."

Counter-view from operators: Commission fees add up, prefer own booking system for control.

## UK Market Update (June 2025)

From a UK court builder's AMA (June 2025), key market intelligence:

**Supply & Demand:**
- ~900 courts currently in UK, 55% outdoor / 45% indoor
- Court numbers have **doubled every year** for last 5 years
- Saturation point estimated at 7,000-8,000 courts
- Significant growth runway still ahead

**Site Acquisition Challenges:**
> "Finding a site is still the hardest part of the whole process. I've got one client who's just done his 38th site visit in Essex and he still doesn't have heads of terms."

> "c.90% of our prospects do not have heads of terms at a site."

Key barrier: Most suitable indoor warehouses are owned by risk-averse pension funds who see leisure as risky.

**Planning Reality Check:**
> "Planning permission is still an absolute farce. We're working on a site in Stockport currently and the amount of professional reports required to submit with the planning application could come close to £18k. This is for a 2 court covered facility."

Required reports can include: acoustic assessments, drainage, ecology, transport... even for small sites.

**Outdoor vs Indoor Economics:**
> "Outdoor with a canopy is becoming a quicker and more feasible route to market. Lower rental costs and business rates means a quicker and safer investment in my opinion."

Despite higher capex (groundworks + canopy), lower opex makes outdoor covered courts attractive.

**Revenue Benchmark (Updated):**
> "One covered court, operating from 7am to 11pm, 7 days a week, is generating around **£160k per year**."

This is based on ~71% occupancy for covered courts.

**LTA Funding Change:**
- LTA interest-free loan scheme has ENDED
- Now 5% interest with challenging terms (e.g., 15 hours/week public access per court)
- Tennis clubs becoming less receptive to padel additions

**Council Opportunities:**
> "Councils are starting to clock on to the opportunity. We've seen a couple of examples where local authorities have identified a piece of land they own and have gone out to tender to Padel operators."

Reason: Councils either can't afford to build themselves (6 are bankrupt!) or want to avoid liability risk.
