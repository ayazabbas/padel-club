## Key Takeaways

| Topic | Insight |
|-------|---------|
| **Revenue** | UK courts generating £100-150k/year per court at good occupancy |
| **Occupancy** | Indoor/covered: ~71% average. Outdoor: ~45% |
| **Break-even** | 18-24 months typical, can be 11 months for ideal sites |
| **Rent** | Should be 1/7 to 1/8 of revenue for healthy margins |
| **Staff** | Human connection essential — automation doesn't work for clubs |
| **Warning** | Some operators have gone into administration with "hands-off" approach |

## Revenue & Economics

### UK Market Data (Feb 2025 AMA - Court Builder)

> "Some courts in the UK are generating £150k per year per court. We know of a site in the midlands which has 10+ courts, 87% occupancy and generates **£1.3m per annum** from court bookings alone. The bar takes £9k a week."

> "Break even depends on the site, average around **18-24 months**. We did a feasibility study for a hotel in Wales and the break even was 11 months."

### Portugal Club Owner (Nov 2024 AMA)

> "The key part of the business is the rent you pay. In our case it's approximately **1/7 to 1/8 of the revenue** so we have a lot of margin for everything else."

> "A big part of the business are the people. If you have good people working it will bring more players and more revenue than automation possibly can."

8 courts, open 07:00-24:00, ~8.3 hours occupancy per day average.

**Napkin math from thread:**
- 8 courts × 8.3 hrs/day × 365 days × €20/hr = **€484,800/year turnover**
- Court cost: ~€30k each indoor
- Additional infrastructure (kitchen, bar, toilets, lockers): ~€150k
- Rent: ~€70k/year (1/7 of turnover)

## Warnings & Failures

### Sweden Market Crash

> "Here we went from 500 courts to maybe less than 50 courts within 2 years. Padel is amazing at bankrupting people."

### Hands-Off Approach Failures

> "Unfortunately operators have gone into administration using this approach [automated/self-sufficient]. A successful club needs to have a good strategy, social experience, dwell time, coaching program etc."

## Critical Success Factors

Based on Reddit discussions:

1. **Location & Rent** — Rent should be <15% of projected revenue
2. **Staff Quality** — Human connection drives repeat business
3. **Community Building** — Social experience, not just courts
4. **Coaching Program** — Revenue stream + player development
5. **Dwell Time** — Bar/café keeps people longer, builds community
6. **Realistic Expectations** — Not a passive income business

## Finding Sites (UK)

> "The site is without a doubt the hardest stage of the process in our experience."

Key challenges:
- Industrial warehouse availability
- Ceiling height requirements (7m+)
- Planning permission for change of use
- Parking and access

## Booking Platforms

### Playtomic Debate

> "Playtomic is not expensive at all for clubs and they get way more benefits than cons. They don't understand their role in the Padel community as a club."

Counter-view from operators: Commission fees add up, prefer own booking system for control.
