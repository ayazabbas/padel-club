## Use Classes Explained

### Class E(d) — Indoor Sport/Recreation

For an **indoor padel club** (warehouse conversion), you would operate under **Use Class E(d)**:

> *"For indoor sport, recreation or fitness, not involving motorised vehicles or firearms, principally to visiting members of the public"*

**Key Benefits:**
- Part of the flexible Class E, which includes shops, restaurants, offices, light industrial
- Changes WITHIN Class E generally don't require planning permission
- If converting from another Class E use (e.g., light industrial B1(c) that's now E(g)(iii)), you may not need change of use permission for the USE itself

**BUT** — you will likely still need planning permission for:
- External alterations (loading doors, facades)
- Signage
- Floodlighting (even internal if windows allow light spill)
- Parking/access changes
- Noise mitigation measures

### Class F2(c) — Outdoor Sport/Recreation

For **outdoor padel courts**, the classification is:

> *"Area or place for outdoor sport or recreation (not involving motorised vehicles or firearms)"*

**Always requires planning permission** for:
- Commercial outdoor sports facilities
- Floodlighting
- Fencing over 2m high (padel requires ~4m)
- Glass walls and steel structures

## Local Plan Policies

### Current Plan: Luton Local Plan 2011-2031

Adopted November 2017. Key relevant policies:

**Policy LLP6 - High Quality Design**
- Development must achieve high quality, sustainable design
- Respect local character and context

**Policy LLP15 - Health and Wellbeing**
- Supports development that promotes active lifestyles
- Sports facilities generally viewed positively

**Policy LLP28 - Open Space and Outdoor Recreation**
- Protects existing open space
- Supports new recreation provision

**Policy LLP31 - Sustainable Transport**

- Call for Sites extended to June 2025

---

## Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL)

### ⭐ Luton Does NOT Charge CIL

**Confirmed:** As of the most recent government research (2018-19), Luton Borough Council had NOT adopted a CIL charging schedule. This remains the case.

**What this means:**
- No CIL liability on new development
- Significant cost saving vs neighbouring areas
- Developer contributions via S106 agreements may still apply for larger schemes

**Compare to neighbours:**
- Central Bedfordshire: Has adopted CIL
- Bedford Borough: Has adopted CIL
- Luton: **No CIL** ✅

## Key Considerations for Padel Courts

### Warehouse Conversion (Indoor)

**Advantages:**
- Weather-protected play
- Year-round operation
- Potentially simpler change of use within Class E
- Can include café, pro shop, changing rooms

**Planning Considerations:**
- Noise (ball impact on glass/walls)
- Operating hours
- Parking provision
- Loading/access changes
- Internal lighting (if visible externally)
- Ventilation/extraction

### Outdoor Courts

**Advantages:**
- Lower build cost
- Authentic padel experience
- Can be on varied land types

**Planning Considerations:**
- Floodlighting (major issue)
- Noise travels further outdoors
- 4m+ fencing/structures
- Visual impact
- Hours restrictions likely (typically ending 9-10pm)

### Floodlighting — The Key Issue

Floodlighting almost always requires planning permission and is often the most contentious element.

**Assessment considers:**
- Light spill to neighbours
- Operating hours
- Column height
- Luminosity levels (lux)
- ILP guidelines compliance

**Typical conditions imposed:**
- Lights off by 9:30pm weekdays, 6pm Sundays
- Automatic cut-off timers
- Light spill modelling compliance

## Existing Padel in Luton/Bedfordshire

### Padel Pass Luton — Venue 360

- **Location:** Venue 360, Gipsy Lane, Luton
- **Courts:** 2 outdoor covered courts
- **Opened:** Summer 2025
- **First padel courts in Bedfordshire**

*Source: [Luton Today, July 2025](https://www.lutontoday.co.uk/sport/padel-pass-brings-the-worlds-fastest-growing-sport-to-bedfordshire-5202472)*

## Recommended Approach

### For Warehouse Conversion

1. **Identify suitable premises** — ideally already Class E use
2. **Request pre-app advice** — £varies based on scale
3. **Commission assessments** — noise, lighting, transport as needed
4. **Submit full application** — expect 8-13 week determination
5. **Building regs application** — separate process for structural changes

### For Outdoor Courts

1. **Assess site constraints** — neighbours, designations, flood risk
2. **Pre-app essential** — higher risk of refusal
3. **Design for mitigation** — acoustic fencing, low-spill lighting
4. **Expect conditions** — restricted hours, lighting controls
