- ✅ Good catchment — retail park footfall

## Cons

- ❌ B8 planning → needs change of use to Class E(d) for leisure
- ❌ **Only Compound 3 available** — size unknown
- ❌ Price unknown (POA) — likely higher than rural alternatives
- ❌ Would need canopy/cover built

## Planning Pathway

| Current | Required | Action |
|---------|----------|--------|
| B8 (Storage/Distribution) | Class E(d) (Indoor sport/recreation/fitness) | Change of use application |

**Positive signals:**
- Council previously approved warehouse on this site (22/00141/FUL, Nov 2022)
- Mixed-use retail park context favorable for leisure
- No Green Belt restrictions

## Comparison to Slip End

|--------|---------|----------|
| Location | **IN Luton** | 2.4mi from Luton |
| Size | Compound 3 only (TBC) | 2.17 acres |
| Price | POA (likely higher) | **£145k freehold** |
| Planning | B8 → Class E | Greenfield (inset Green Belt) |
| Visibility | **Prime retail park** | Rural |
