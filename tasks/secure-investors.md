# Secure Investors

**Status:** ⏳ Not Started  
**Target:** Q1 2026  
**Dependencies:** Property enquiries (to have concrete options to present)

---

## Objective

Raise £95-120k additional capital through equity investment (Musharakah structure — halal, profit-sharing).

---

## Immediate Tasks

### 1. Prepare Materials
- [ ] Review [Investor Pitch](../investor-pitch) — ensure all numbers are current
- [ ] Update pitch with specific property options (once confirmed)
- [ ] Prepare 1-page summary for casual conversations
- [ ] Have [Financial Model](../research/financial-model) ready for deep-dive questions

### 2. Identify Potential Investors
- [ ] **Friends & Family**
  - List contacts who might have £25-50k+ to invest
  - Focus on those who understand/appreciate halal structure
  - Note: Don't approach until you have concrete property option
- [ ] **Local Business Community**
  - Luton business networking groups
  - Muslim business associations (natural fit for Musharakah)
  - Sports/padel enthusiasts with capital
- [ ] **Angel Investors**
  - UK Business Angels Association
  - Regional angel networks (Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire)
  - Note: Many angels want equity + control — may not suit

### 3. Understand Investor Concerns
Prepare answers for:
- [ ] "What's the worst case?" — Show sensitivity analysis
- [ ] "When do I get my money back?" — Explain exit options
- [ ] "Who else is investing?" — Partners' £80k skin in the game
- [ ] "What if it fails?" — Limited liability structure, no personal guarantees
- [ ] "Why Luton?" — Underserved market, no CIL, M1 access

## When Property is Confirmed

### 4. Active Outreach
- [ ] Reach out to warm contacts first
- [ ] Share investor pitch deck
- [ ] Offer property viewing for serious prospects
- [ ] Be clear on terms: 25-30% equity for £100k

### 5. Alternative Funding (Parallel Track)
- [ ] Apply for Sport England Movement Fund (up to £15k)
- [ ] Research Qardus for gap funding (Murabaha structure)
- [ ] Check LSPAN small grants (up to £500)

See [Islamic Finance Options](../research/islamic-finance) for details.

## Solicitor Required ⚖️

### 6. Legal Structure Setup
- [ ] **Engage solicitor** — commercial + company formation experience
- [ ] **Form company** — Ltd preferred (clearer liability)
- [ ] **Shareholder agreement** — covering:
  - Equity splits (founders vs investors)
  - Profit distribution schedule (quarterly recommended)
  - Exit mechanisms (buyback, sale, etc.)
  - Decision-making (board votes, reserved matters)
  - Deadlock resolution
- [ ] **Investment agreement** — Musharakah-compliant terms
  - Profit-sharing ratios
  - Loss-sharing provisions (proportional to capital)
  - No interest clauses
  - Exit/buyout terms

**Budget:** £2-5k for legal setup
